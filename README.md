# Coursera-Algorithms-Course
This repo consists of all the code written by Shubham Ojha for submission and learning. Feel free to use it for reference. 
For running the java classes in the command line, a lot of code needs to be commented out. Please see what line needs to be commented out.

Currently this repo contains:

 - Learning Equipment: contains all the resources shared by the instructors during the course
 - Week 1 - Percolation: assignment for week 1


Will be filled as I complete the course
